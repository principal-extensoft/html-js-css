Here’s what I’ve got saved as your preferences:

Use ASP .NET .cshtml pages with output caching for all SEO‐critical landing and product pages.

Implement the cart as a Vue 3 widget via the CDN (no build step).

Persist carts server-side, keyed by a small Cart ID cookie (HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax).

Support multiple named carts per Member (e.g. “Christmas,” “Birthdays,” etc.).

Manage releases with Microsoft.FeatureManagement feature flags stored in your database, plus an admin UI for flipping bits.

Roll out features canary-style by percentage (using the built-in percentage filter) without requiring a hardware load-balancer.
